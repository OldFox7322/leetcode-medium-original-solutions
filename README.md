# LeetCode Medium – Original Solutions

This repository contains a personal collection of original solutions to selected **LeetCode Medium** problems, written in Python.

### 🔹 Why this repository?

The main goal is to demonstrate:
- The ability to **analyze and solve algorithmic problems independently**
- A focus on **clear logic**, even if not always the most optimized solution
- Growth-oriented thinking: *“I can solve any problem — even if I still refine my approach with experience.”*

Each solution is written **without copying** community templates or references, to reflect **true understanding and decision-making** at this stage of my career.

>  The number of problems in this repository will continue to grow weekly as I regularly take on new challenges.
